   "source": "# Create Architecture\nMedallion Architecture is a data design pattern used in modern data lakes, data warehouses, and data lakehouses to structure data processing.  \n\nIt organizes data into three layers:\n  \n * Bronze Layer: Raw, untransformed data ingested from various sources. It serves as the foundation.  \n * Silver Layer: Cleaned and transformed data, ready for analysis or further processing.  \n * Gold Layer: Aggregated, highly curated data optimized for business intelligence or machine learning.\n\nThis structure ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of data management by providing incremental transformations across layers.  \n\nRun the next cell (labeled \"CreateSchemas\") to create these layers.\n\n![Bronze-Silver-Gold Schemas](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1011/1*9yThWS7vvZTGmhFnhVF19Q.png)  "

Daily real data on the work of oil wells.\n\nThis well was drilled in 2013 at an oil field in the north of Russia. \nThe depth of this well is 2400 meters.\n\nAn oil reservoir contains oil and gas dissolved in it under high pressure. There is water in the reservoir below the oil.\nAfter the completion of the well construction, a pump is lowered into the well, into which a liquid containing oil, gas and water is supplied. \n\nOn the surface of the well, a sample is taken every day, which shows how much water and oil is contained in this well in percent (column5 - \"Water cut (%)\") . \n\nFrom the well, the liquid enters the metering unit, which calculates how much fluid the well produces per day (column2 - \"Volume of liquid (m3 / day)\") and how much gas (column3 - \"Gas volume (m3 / day)\"). Knowing the above parameters, I calculate how much oil the well produces (column1 - \"Oil volume (m3 / day)\"). From the well, the liquid enters the metering unit, which calculates how much fluid the well produces per day (column2 - \"Volume of liquid (m3 / day)\") and how much gas (column3 - \"Gas volume (m3 / day)\"). Knowing the above parameters, I calculate how much oil the well produces (column1 - \"Oil volume (m3 / day)\") and how much water (column4 - \"Water volume (m3 / day))\").Also, data about the dynamic level (column7 - \"Dynamic level (meters)\") is taken every day. \n\nA sensor is installed in the pump, which is lowered into the well, which shows reservoir pressure in the well (column8 - \"Reservoir pressure (atm)\") As the well is operated, reservoir pressure begins to decrease, and oil production decreases accordingly. There is less oil and gas, more water - the oil field begins to deplete. The field's profitability is falling."
